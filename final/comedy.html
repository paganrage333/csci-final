            <h2>texting a member of the NC house of representatives</h2>
            <p>for several months in my senior year of high school i texted with a republican member</p>
            <p>of the NC house of representatives pretending to be an old college buddy. I made up old </p>
            <p>memories and he went along with them, I had other friends text him as fake people</p>
            <p>and he never acknowledged that any of it wasn't real. </p>
            <p>you can read our full conversation <a href="https://imgur.com/a/6MxQa">here</a>.</p>

            <h2>stand up comedy</h2>
            <p>in 2019 after doing standup comedy for about a year i went on tour</p>
            <p>opening for the band <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3EYgeLZ0vtVHKkUL26Eu49?si=OTsc_CvGRPik8zLHNnN9Pg">Prince Daddy & the Hyena</a> performing a very</p>
            <p>loose five to ten minute "comedy" set. there is no documentation of</p>
            <p>any of these sets, thank god, but it goes to show that you don't have</p>
            <p>to be good at something to do it! sometimes people who are bad </p>
            <p>at what they do go really far, like James Corden or Radiohead!</p>
